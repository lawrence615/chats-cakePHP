This is the first version of an app I made that uses highchats in reporting checking time in an event.

I made it for my own practice as well as for anyone out there who may  want to achieve the same.

It is really simple but I hope to advance it. However, any contribution is very much welcomed.

How to run it.
1. Import the database provided in the data folder.
2. Change the Database connection to match that of your server
3. Navigate to http://localhost/chats/attendees
NB: if you are running it on a server, change the localhost to your domain name

I am aware of a plugin that can do exactly  the same thing plus much more, but I find it easier to work with json and ajax. Morever,
these minimises the coding.
